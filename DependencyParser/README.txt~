1b. To determine whether a dependency graph is projective, we first make a
list of all the arcs in the dependency graph. We then go through each arc in
this list, identifying if there is any other arc that has both one end (i.e.
either a head or a dependent) that lies within the original arc and another
end that lies outside the original arc. That is, we go through each arc and
determine if there is another arc that overlaps it.


1c. Sentence with projective dependency graph: "I ate some meat."
Sentence with non-projective dependency graph: "Fred opened a door today that had no handle." 'today' is connected to 'open' while the
subsentence 'that had no handle' is connected to 'door.'
